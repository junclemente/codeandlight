    <p>I am a full stack web developer, knowledgeable in developing the logical, software side and the visual, user-facing side of your website.</p>
    <p>I use Python and Flask in the back-end and JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap on the front-end, but I am always open to learning new languages and frameworks.</p>

    <h5 class="light-font text-norm">light</h5>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I like to capture moments of light with my camera to create visually appealing photographs that also encompasses an experience.</p>
    <p>With front-end development, I follow the same concept. I try to create a visually appealing user interface that also provides a positive user experience.</p>
