    <p>I am a full stack web developer, knowledgeable in developing the logical, software side and the visual, user-facing side of your website.</p>

    <p>I used to worked in the pharmaceutical/biotech industry but after participating in <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2012/01/06/technology/code_year/index.htm" target="_blank">"Code Year 2012"</a>, I discovered that I really enjoyed coding. I decided to take programming a little more seriously and took <a href="https://www.thinkful.com" target="_blank">Thinkful.com's</a> <em>Python Programming and Backend Development</em> course. Afterwards, I developed a <em>Training Website</em> for the company I was working for. This site focused on delivering and tracking employee training using the various technologies I learned through Thinkful, mainly using Python and MySQL database.</p>

    <p>Over the past two years, I decided that I wanted to switch careers to become a developer. To help with that, I went with <a href="https://www.udacity.com" target="_blank">Udacity.com's</a> Nanodegree programs. Since I already have knowledge of back-end programming through Thinkful, I decided to take the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001" target="_blank">Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program</a>. After completing that nanodegree, I felt that I needed a little bit more. To refresh my knowledge in back-end development and to learn new technologies that I didn't learn previously, I enrolled in the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree Program</a>.</p>

    <p>Thanks for stopping by and please check out my projects. If you'd like me to help you with your website, please contact me through email or connect with me on LinkedIn.</p>
